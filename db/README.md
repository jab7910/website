# Local Postgres

Enter the Nix dev shell, then use the helper functions from `flake.nix`:

```sh
nix develop
btcpp_pg_start
btcpp_pg_migrate
btcpp_pg_psql
```

`btcpp_pg_migrate` applies every SQL file in `db/migrations` in filename
order.

The default local connection string is exported as:

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://btcpp@127.0.0.1:55432/btcpp_dev?sslmode=disable
```

The app now requires a working `DATABASE_URL` at startup because HTTP sessions
are stored in Postgres rather than a local Bolt file.

Data lives under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/btcpp-web/postgres` or
`$HOME/.local/share/btcpp-web/postgres` by default. This avoids permission
problems when the repo is checked out on a Windows-mounted WSL path. Override
`BTCPP_PGDATA`, `BTCPP_PGRUN`, or `BTCPP_PGLOG` if you want a different local
location.

Stop the local server with:

```sh
btcpp_pg_stop
```

To drop, recreate, and migrate the local database while Postgres is healthy:

```sh
btcpp_pg_reset
```

To import the current Shopify catalog from `shop.btcpp.dev` into the local
merch tables:

```sh
go run ./cmd/import-shopify-merch -dry-run
go run ./cmd/import-shopify-merch
```

The importer reads Shopify's public `products.json`, upserts products by handle
and variants by SKU or Shopify variant ID, stores Shopify CDN image URLs, and
adds a one-time default stock event for available variants. Override that local
stock placeholder with `-available-stock-default=0` or another quantity.

To mirror Shopify images into DigitalOcean Spaces at the same time:

```sh
go run ./cmd/import-shopify-merch -upload-images
```

This downloads each Shopify image, uploads the original under
`merch/shopify/{handle}/`, generates an AVIF derivative, uploads that sibling,
and stores the AVIF Spaces object key in `merch_product_images`.

If Postgres itself cannot start because the local data directory is stale or
corrupt, explicitly rebuild the local dev database with:

```sh
just dev-reset-db
```

This moves the previous local data directory aside with a `.reset-<timestamp>`
suffix before creating a fresh one.

## Schema Migrations

Migration files live in `db/migrations` and are applied in numeric prefix
order. The web app runs pending migrations automatically on startup.

Applied migrations are tracked in the database in `schema_migrations`. Existing
databases that already have the initial schema are baselined as migration `001`
on first startup, then later migrations are applied normally. Migration SQL is
read from disk at runtime; deploys must include the checked-in `db/migrations`
directory alongside the app.

To run the same migration path manually:

```sh
make db-migrate
```

This repo includes a tracked pre-commit hook that rejects duplicate migration
number prefixes, such as adding a second `002_*.sql`. Enable it in a checkout
with:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath githooks
```

To replace the local database with a sanitized copy of production:

```sh
PROD_DATABASE_URL='postgres://...' make db-pull-sanitized
```

This target must be run inside `nix develop`. It dumps production to a
temporary custom-format archive, drops and recreates the local database,
restores the archive into the local Postgres instance, then runs
`db/sanitize.sql` to remove contact details, live invite tokens, calendar
notification IDs, source media URIs, notes, coupon codes, and ticket checkout
IDs. After the restore, it also applies any newer local migrations from
`db/migrations`.

To replace the local database with an unsanitized copy, you must provide the
admin secret whose SHA-256 matches the hardcoded allowlist digest:

```sh
PROD_DATABASE_URL='postgres://...' \
ADMIN_BYPASS='...' \
make db-pull-unsanitized
```

This skips `db/sanitize.sql` entirely and restores the production data as-is.
It still applies any newer local migrations from `db/migrations`. Use it
carefully.
